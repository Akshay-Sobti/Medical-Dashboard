Hi, 
So I have created this medical dashboard using React, Material UI and TypeScript.

Now, there were two sub folders inside “src” folder and they were “components” and “pages”. 
There were two files (App.tsx and main.tsx) inside src folder. 

Components folder consisted of eight files: 

• Chart.tsx 
• HistoryTable.tsx 
• Navbar.tsx 
• NotesPage.tsx 
• PatientsByDepartment.tsx 
• Schedule.tsx 
• Sidebar.tsx 
• TestsTable.tsx 

Pages folder consisted of four files: 
• Dashboard.tsx 
• Login.tsx 
• Profile.tsx 
• Settings.tsx 

THANK YOU!!
